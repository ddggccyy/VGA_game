WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (PDRC-153) Gated clock check - Net game/VGA_Disp/pe is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin game/VGA_Disp/pau_i_2/O, cell game/VGA_Disp/pau_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (PLHOLDVIO-2) Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations - A LUT game/VGA_Disp/pau_i_2 is driving clock pin of 1 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved cells are:
